# Arc Launcher

## Description
One new weapon, an anti mech/shield/turret Arc Launcher.

Gated behind the Charged Shot research this weapon fires an energy projectile which bursts into a powerful EMP blast.

## Acquiring
The Arc Launcher can be bought from traders, or built at a fabrication bench.

## Bill of Materials
At the fabrication bench you can make you own, once Charged Shot has been researched. Costs and time are identical to the Charge Rifle
* 50 Plasteel
* 2 Spacer Components
* 167 Seconds (10,000 ticks)

## More stats
The weapon copies the accuracies and ranges of the Incendiary Launcher

The shot has a larger radius and damage though, 85 EMP damage in a 2.5 tile radius

## Notes
Beware! The Arc launcher might (rarely) replace a Charge Rifle on a Mercenary Elite, giving raiders a way to stun your turrets or strip the shields from your brawlers.

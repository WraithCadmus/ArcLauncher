	<description>V0.4.0

==Description==
One new weapon, an anti mech/shield/turret Arc Launcher.
Gated behind the Charged Shot research this weapon fires an energy projectile which bursts into a powerful EMP blast.

==Acquiring==
The Arc Launcher can be bought from traders, or built at a fabrication bench.

==Bill of Materials==
At the fabrication bench you can make you own, once Charged Shot has been researched. Costs and time are identical to the Charge Rifle
* 50 Plasteel
* 2 Spacer Components
* 167 Seconds (10,000 ticks)

==More stats==
The weapon copies the accuracies and ranges of the Incendiary Launcher
The shot has a larger radius and damage though, 85 EMP damage in a 2.5 tile radius

==Notes==
Beware! The Arc launcher might (rarely) replace a Charge Rifle on a Mercenary Elite, giving raiders a way to stun your turrets or strip the shields from your brawlers.
